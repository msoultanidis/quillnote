Quillpad is a fork of an original app called Quillnote. Quillpad is fully free and open-source. It will never show you ads, ask you for unnecessary permissions or upload your notes anywhere without you knowing.

Take beautiful markdown notes whenever you feel inspired, place them in notebooks and tag them accordingly. Stay organized by making task lists, set reminders and keep everything in one place by attaching related files.
