## Colors
The main "brand" colors are:
- ![#f03c15](https://placehold.co/15x15/a4c639/a4c639.png) `#a4c639` [Android green (pre-2018)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_green)
- ![#1589F0](https://placehold.co/15x15/1a1a1a/1a1a1a.png) `#1a1a1a` 90% gray

## Logo
When used as an icon, the gray background is used with a green quill. <br>
In other cases, the logo is used with a white background and green quill.

It consists of a quill (`quill.svg`) used as part of the letter 'Q' (`Q_centered.svg`).
Currently, the height of the Q is 1.2 times it's width, however this may be subject to change. <br>
The quill is integrated into the circle by applying a slight stroke to it, which can then be removed from the circle using 
a difference operation on both paths. This results in some slight negative space around the quill, making it more visible.

The complete Q must always fit into a circle with a diameter of 72px (assuming Android icon guidelines) as shown in `adaptive_icon.svg`.
